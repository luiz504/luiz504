 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Luiz's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

My coding journey is a testament to my diverse background, forged over a decade of commercial experiences. From my early days as a curious mechanic tearing apart gadgets to roles in restocking, sales, and administration, I embraced technology's integration into various operations. Navigating responsibilities like ERP management, purchasing, and logistics, I became a versatile business asset.

Having graduated in Accounting in 2018, I found myself at a crossroads. Encouraged by my natural tech inclination, I ventured into introductory coding courses on YouTube. What began as an experiment soon transformed into a passion that ignited my drive. Coding is where I discovered my purpose—an avenue to solve problems and create boundless possibilities.

This journey is a continuous learning process that I wholeheartedly embrace. Each day, I relish unraveling coding puzzles and diving into new technologies, refining my skills to bridge the gap between innovation and practicality. Armed with this diverse experience and an unyielding commitment to growth, I'm on a mission to translate my unique path into crafting digital solutions that make a difference.
